Things have been going pretty slow. I currently have the board randomized and being printed. Haven't started on the logic for moving cards. Unicode characters are attempting to be an issue when using setw() to manipulate output streams. I have decided I am going to work with a single digit (0 for 10, A for 1, J for 11, Q for 12, K for 13) and a letter of the first suit instead of working with the unicode deck of cards characters. I can always implement that later.
