Assignment information:

I will code Freecell. I will use unicode characters and colors to differentiate specific cards.

The board would look similar to the following.
```

------|----------|------------
     🂠|🂡🂱🃁🃑🂢🂲🃂🃒|🂠♠     
     🂠|🂡🂱🃁🃑🂢🂲🃂🃒|🂠♥
     🂠|🂡🂱🃁🃑🂢🂲🃂🃒|🂠♣
     🂠|🂡🂱🃁🃑🂢🂲🃂🃒|🂠♦
      |🂡🂱🃁🃑🂢🂲🃂🃒|
      |🂡🂱🃁🃑🂢🂲🃂🃒|
      |🂡🂱🃁🃑🂢🂲🃂🃒|
      |🂡🂱🃁🃑     |
```
There will be a class for printing specific cards/colors. There will also be a class for all the logic bits in FreeCell.
The logic class will inherit the printing specific cards class/colors.

There will be methods for printing the board and moving cards to specific places. There will be methods for printing cards and colors.
